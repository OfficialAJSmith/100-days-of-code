# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Nov 26 2018

**Today's Progress: I started creating the @FreeCodeCamp Tribute page to get started on something easy. 

**Thoughts:** I really liked using Codepen.io to do the work for the challenge.

### Day 2: Nov 27 2018

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS for the Tribute page to be reactive to pass all tests. Did research and played around with jQueary and Json data.

**Thoughts**: It was interesting watching the video sponsored by FreeCodeCamp about Jqueary and Json for my next project. I missed part of day two but making up for it by doing two hours on the third day. 

### Day 3: Nov 27 2018

**Today's Progress**: Day 4 of #100DaysOfCode  I worked on my #minecraft template and some bootstrap 4 stuff.  Will do the backend work and mess around with some Handlebar.js tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: There is a ton of Bootstrap 4 classes. Good thing search engines are around to find them until I learn some of them.
