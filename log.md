# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Nov 26 2018

**Today's Progress: I started creating the @FreeCodeCamp Tribute page to get started on something easy. 

**Thoughts:** I really liked using Codepen.io to do the work for the challenge. 

**Link to work:** [Codepen.io profile](https://codepen.io/Awesomesmith/pen/MzBGWv)

### Day 2: Nov 27 2018

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS for the Tribute page to be reactive to pass all tests. Did research and played around with jQueary and Json data.

**Thoughts**: It was interesting watching the video sponsored by FreeCodeCamp about Jqueary and Json for my next project. I missed part of day two but making up for it by doing two hours on the third day. 


### Day 3: Nov 29 2018

**Today's Progress**: Day 3 of #100DaysOfCode I did some refreshing on Bootstrap 4 and planned my layout for the design of the #Minecraft status page. And it looks like for some reason my day two tweet mentions day 3 lol.

**Thoughts**: Read some of the Bootstrap 4 docs. 


### Day 4: Nov 30 2018

**Today's Progress**: Day 4 of #100DaysOfCode  I worked on my #minecraft template and some bootstrap 4 stuff.  Will do the backend work and mess around with some Handlebar.js tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: There is a ton of Bootstrap 4 classes. Good thing search engines are around to find them until I learn some of them. 

### Day 5: Dec 1 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
Day 5 of #100DaysOfCode: Today I got my Javascript/Json backend to work for the #Minecraft status page. Tomorrow I will tweak it and clean it up for mobile viewing. Maybe add some more features.

### Day 6: Dec 4 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
Day 6 of #100DaysOfCode Today I played around with some #CSS border styles to decide if that's what I want to surround my server status info. I think I may looking something different.  Will have to scan some websites for inspiration.

**Thoughts**: Can't seem to get Jquery and Handlebar.js to work together. Will need to look into it more. 

### Day 7: Dec 5/6 2018

**Today's Progress**:
Day 7 of #100DaysOfCode #freeCodeCamp
Today I watched some more tutorials on #handlebarsjs and attempted to setup a Mac OS #VM. The input is not liking my mouse. Will try a different mouse in morning
